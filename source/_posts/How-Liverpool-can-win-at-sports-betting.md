This means that they always attract plenty of attention from bookmakers and there are lots of markets available on their games. So, if you are thinking of betting on Liverpool FC, what should you look out for?

One thing to bear in mind is that Liverpool often perform better in the second half of the season. This is due to manager Jürgen Klopp’s high-intensity tactics which can take time to wear teams down. So, if you are considering betting on Liverpool fixtures, it may be worth waiting until later on in the campaign.

Another thing to consider is that Liverpool are a very attacking side and they often score a lot of goals. In fact, they have averaged 2.5 goals per game over the last three seasons. This makes them a great option for both Over 2.5 Match Goals and BTTS bets.

Defensively, Liverpool can be a bit shaky at times and they tend to concede goals. In fact, they have conceded an average of 1.8 goals per game over the last three seasons. This makes them vulnerable to conceding cheap goals and could lead to high-scoring matches. As such, Over 3 Match Goals bets could be a good option when betting on Liverpool games.
