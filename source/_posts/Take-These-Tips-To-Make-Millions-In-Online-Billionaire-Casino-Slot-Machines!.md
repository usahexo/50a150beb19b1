They're supposedly games of chance, but as we'll see later on, there's actually quite a bit of skill involved in playing them effectively.  So without further ado, let's get started!

What Are Casino Slot Machines?


  Casino slot machines are electronic gaming devices that use spinning reels to determine winners. Slot machines can be found in casinos around the world and come in all shapes and sizes. The three most common types of slot machines are video slots, classic slots, and progressive slots. Progressive slots are linked together across different casinos and often offer life-changing jackpots. 

 In most cases, players insert cash into the machine or use a debit card or credit card to place wagers. They then hit one or more buttons to spin the reels. If any of the symbols on the reels line up correctly, players win money based on their wager and the applicable payout schedule.Slot machines have become increasingly popular over time due to their simple gameplay mechanics and potentially high payouts.

 Casino Slot Machine Basics

Now that we know what casino slot machines are all about, let's take a look at some of the basics players need to know before they start playing them:

  • Payout percentages – Slot machines typically have payout percentages between 80% and 98%. This means for every $100 players bet on average, they will lose between $20 and $80 over time. However, there are some exceptions with high payout percentage games available which we'll discuss later on in this article. 
• House edge – The house edge is the percentage of each wager that casinos keep as profit over time. This figure varies depending on which type of casino game is being played, but is usually between 1% and 5%. For slot machines, this number ranges from 2% to 10%. So for every $100 bet over time, casinos will keep between $2 and $10 as profit (on average). 
• RTP – The return to player (RTP) is the amount of money returned to players over time expressed as a percentage. So for every $100 bet placed in total (across multiple bets), players can expect to receive back an average of between 95% and 99%. This includes both wins AND losses incurred while playing casino games.$100 96% Return To Player$200 97% Return To Player$300 98% Return To Player Now that we understand these basics concepts, we're ready dive into my personal strategy for beating casino slot machines!
