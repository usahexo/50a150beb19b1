<p>The theft occurred on Sunday morning when a man entered the casino and headed for the baccarat tables. Surveillance footage showed the man picking up six glasses and leaving the casino through an emergency exit.</p>
<p>When security checked the footage, they noticed that the man had not actually played any games at the baccarat table and was likely only after the glasses themselves.</p>
<p>The casino has offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the thief. In addition, they have increased security measures in an attempt to prevent future thefts.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the casino said that it was unclear how much money was missing from the till, but that it was likely around $1 million.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a casino has been targeted by thieves looking for luxury items. In 2013, a man stole more than $1 million in watches from The Bellagio hotel and casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<h1 id="5-000-000-Stolen-In-Vegas-Casino-Baccarat-Glasses-Heist"><a href="#5-000-000-Stolen-In-Vegas-Casino-Baccarat-Glasses-Heist" class="headerlink" title="$5,000,000 Stolen In Vegas Casino Baccarat Glasses Heist"></a>$5,000,000 Stolen In Vegas Casino Baccarat Glasses Heist</h1><p>Las Vegas–Tuesday night, a brazen casino heist involving $5,000,000 worth of Baccarat glasses occurred at the Bellagio Resort and Casino. The theft was carried out by a team of well-dressed thieves who made their escape in a waiting van.</p>
<p>According to police reports, the thieves entered the casino through an emergency exit that led into the back of the resort’s gift shop. They then proceeded to steal an estimated 250 pairs of Baccarat glasses from a locked storage room.</p>
<p>The glasses, which are worth about $20 each on the retail market, are used for playing the popular casino game Baccarat. In addition to their value as gaming accessories, the glasses are also considered collector’s items.</p>
<p>“This is a major robbery,” said Las Vegas Police Captain Tom Jenkins. “We’re talking about a million bucks’ worth of glasses here.”</p>
<p>Police are still investigating the robbery and have released no information on possible suspects. In the meantime, casino officials say they are reviewing security footage in an effort to identify the thieves.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that high-end casino items have been targeted by thieves. In 2011, a team of burglars made off with over $1 million worth of chips from the Bellagio Casino.</p>
<h1 id="Over-1-000-000-Missing-After-Latest-Vegas-Casino-Baccarat-Glasses-Heist"><a href="#Over-1-000-000-Missing-After-Latest-Vegas-Casino-Baccarat-Glasses-Heist" class="headerlink" title="Over $1,000,000 Missing After Latest Vegas Casino Baccarat Glasses Heist"></a>Over $1,000,000 Missing After Latest Vegas Casino Baccarat Glasses Heist</h1><p>Las Vegas, NV - The owner of the Rio casino is looking for answers after over $1 million went missing following the latest heist in which a group of baccarat glasses were stolen.</p>
<p>The glasses, which are used to determine winners and losers in the popular card game, were taken from a secure area of the casino on Saturday. Staff immediately noticed that they were missing and alerted management.</p>
<p>A review of security footage reveals that four men entered the secure area at around 11pm and left about 20 minutes later, with the glasses in hand.</p>
<p>“We are doing everything we can to find those responsible and get our money back,” said a spokesperson for the casino. “This is a major theft and we intend to pursue all legal avenues available to us.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that baccarat glasses have been stolen from a Las Vegas casino. In 2016, a group of thieves made off with over $100,000 worth of glasses from the Bellagio.</p>
<p>It is unclear how much the thieves stand to gain from selling the stolen glasses, as they are only worth a few hundred dollars each. However, it is possible that they may be able to pawn them off for a much higher price given their unique nature.</p>

<p>The money was part of a larger haul that was being transported for counting at the end of a baccarat game. But when the count was finished, $2 million was unaccounted for.</p>
<p>Police were initially stumped as to where the money could have gone. But after a painstaking investigation that lasted several months, they finally traced the money back to a theft by a casino employee.</p>
<p>The employee, who has not been identified, is said to have stolen the money by smuggling it out of the casino in a pair of glasses.</p>
<p>The glasses were then allegedly smuggled into Los Angeles, where the money was laundered through a number of businesses before being deposited into bank accounts.</p>
<p>Police are still trying to determine how the employee managed to get away with the theft for so long without being detected. But they say they have now recovered all of the stolen money.</p>

Investigators say that Carleo walked into the casino and took a set of glasses from a display case. He then got into a waiting car and fled the scene.</p>
<p>Detectives were able to identify Carleo as the thief thanks to surveillance footage. They also found out that he had recently cashed in several large checks totaling over $1,000,000. When questioned by police, Carleo admitted to stealing the glasses but said that he did not know how much they were worth.</p>
<p>He has been charged with burglary and grand larceny and is currently being held on $1,000,000 bail.</p>
