With several casinos and hotels, the city is a popular destination for people living in New York City.</p>
<p>Despite being close to New York City, Atlantic City is a world away. The boardwalks, beaches, and casinos give the city a unique feel that is perfect for a weekend getaway.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things to do in Atlantic City. In addition to gambling, visitors can enjoy concerts, shows, and restaurants. The nightlife is also vibrant, with plenty of clubs and bars to choose from.</p>
<p>The casinos in Atlantic City are some of the best in the country. There are dozens of different games available, including slots, blackjack, poker, and roulette. Players can also bet on sports or horses at the racetrack.</p>
<p>Hotels in Atlantic City offer great deals for those looking to stay overnight. Many of the hotels are located right on the boardwalk or within walking distance of the casinos.</p>
<p>Getting to Atlantic City is easy. There are several airports nearby, including Newark Liberty International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport. Amtrak also has a station in Atlantic City, making it easy to get there by train.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a fun weekend getaway, head to Atlantic City! The casinos are top-notch, the beaches are beautiful, and the nightlife is always exciting.</p>
<h1 id="New-Yorkers-Flee-to-Jersey-to-Gamble"><a href="#New-Yorkers-Flee-to-Jersey-to-Gamble" class="headerlink" title="New Yorkers Flee to Jersey to Gamble"></a>New Yorkers Flee to Jersey to Gamble</h1><p>The casino industry in New Jersey is booming, thanks in part to New Yorkers who have been crossing the border to gamble.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Associated Press, casinos in Atlantic City are reporting record numbers of visitors, with many of those visitors coming from New York.</p>
<p>And it’s not just people from New York City who are making the trip; people from all over the state are making the trip to Atlantic City to gamble.</p>
<p>This is good news for the casino industry in New Jersey, which has been struggling in recent years. In fact, the casino industry in New Jersey was on the brink of collapse just a few years ago.</p>
<p>But things have turned around in recent years, thanks in part to increased competition from casinos in nearby states. And now, with New Yorkers fleeing to Jersey to Gamble, things are looking even better for the casino industry in New Jersey.</p>
<h1 id="New-Yorkers-Taking-their-Business-to-Jersey"><a href="#New-Yorkers-Taking-their-Business-to-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="New Yorkers Taking their Business to Jersey"></a>New Yorkers Taking their Business to Jersey</h1><p>A recent study found that a growing number of businesses are leaving Manhattan for the suburbs of New Jersey. In fact, the number of businesses choosing to operate in Jersey City, Newark, and other municipalities in the Garden State has surpassed the number of businesses relocating to or expanding within Manhattan.</p>
<p>According to commercial real estate services firm JLL, this trend is being driven by a combination of high rents and labor costs in New York City, as well as a desire by business owners to be outside of Manhattan’s intense 24&#x2F;7 hustle and bustle. Additionally, many suburban NJ municipalities offer more favorable tax rates and zoning rules than their counterpart in New York.</p>
<p>For example, the average asking rent per square foot in Jersey City is $39, while in Manhattan it is $87. And while the average salary for a worker in Manhattan is $78,000, the corresponding salary in Jersey City is only $50,000. This means that businesses can save on both rent and labor costs by moving to Jersey City.</p>
<p>There are also many suburban NJ municipalities that are designated as “Opportunity Zones” by the federal government. These zones offer tax breaks and other incentives to businesses that choose to operate there.</p>
<p>So far, the exodus of businesses from Manhattan has had little impact on the city’s economy. Vacancy rates for office space remain low, and new developments continue to be announced. However, as rental prices and labor costs continue to increase, it is likely that even more businesses will relocate to suburban NJ municipalities.</p>
<h1 id="Jersey-a-Popular-Destination-for-New-Yorkers-Seeking-Gambling-Opportunities"><a href="#Jersey-a-Popular-Destination-for-New-Yorkers-Seeking-Gambling-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="Jersey a Popular Destination for New Yorkers Seeking Gambling Opportunities"></a>Jersey a Popular Destination for New Yorkers Seeking Gambling Opportunities</h1><p>Residents of the New York metro area have plenty of reasons to cross into New Jersey for gambling opportunities. Thanks to online casinos, horseracing tracks, and a lottery, there are a number of ways for New Yorkers to try their luck without having to leave the state.</p>
<p>First, online casinos offer a range of games that can be played on desktop or mobile devices. These include slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker variants. Some sites also offer live dealer games that let players interact with real dealers through streaming video. </p>
<p>Second, the horseracing industry in New Jersey is well established. There are six tracks in the state, offering both thoroughbred and harness racing. In addition to regular races, several tracks offer multi-million dollar jackpots on major events. </p>
<p>Finally, lotteries in New Jersey offer some of the best odds in the country. The Powerball jackpot regularly exceeds $300 million and has surpassed $1 billion on two occasions. The Mega Millions jackpot often tops $250 million. </p>
<p>Combine these options with excellent transportation links and it’s easy to see why New Jersey is a popular destination for New Yorkers seeking gambling opportunities.</p>
<h1 id="More-New-Yorkers-Than-Ever-are-Heading-to-Jersey-for-Gambling"><a href="#More-New-Yorkers-Than-Ever-are-Heading-to-Jersey-for-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="More New Yorkers Than Ever are Heading to Jersey for Gambling."></a>More New Yorkers Than Ever are Heading to Jersey for Gambling.</h1><p>In the past, people who lived in New York City generally traveled to Atlantic City, located in New Jersey, for casino gambling. Atlantic City was once a popular destination for people from the Northeast and nearby states. However, in recent years, many more New Yorkers have been traveling to casinos in other states, such as Pennsylvania and Connecticut.</p>
<p>The main reason for this trend is that Atlantic City has been struggling recently. Its casinos have been closing, and its economy has been weak. In contrast, the economies of Pennsylvania and Connecticut have been doing better lately. As a result, more people are traveling to those states to gamble.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why the casino industry is doing better in Pennsylvania and Connecticut than it is in New Jersey. For one thing, the taxes on casino gambling are higher in Pennsylvania and Connecticut than they are in New Jersey. Additionally, the casinos in Pennsylvania and Connecticut are newer than the casinos in Atlantic City are. Finally, the availability of online gambling may be contributing to the decline of Atlantic City’s casinos.</p>
<p>Some people believe that Atlantic City can still turn things around. They argue that its location – just a short drive from Philadelphia and New York – makes it a desirable destination for casino gambling. Furthermore, they claim that the state government could do more to help revive the city’s economy.</p>
<p>Others believe that it is time for Atlantic City to give up on casino gambling altogether. They say that the city should focus on developing other types of tourism, such as its beaches and boardwalks.</p>
